			Hello!!

I'm try to make a interesting project on SQL.

In this project I attached all the required file, download and load it to your server
then run the queries.

Here I used PostgreSQL.
I extrect so many insights from the data like

a. Senior Employees, best regions of sales,
top artists and many more.
b. I devided the whole project into 3 part
	Easy->Moderate->Advance
c. Also I used complex joins, sub-query, window function and CTF


``Hope you enjoyed to do this project and gathered
	so many insights from this data set.      ``
